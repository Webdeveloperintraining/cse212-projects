Consider the following scenario:

    Write code to find the first time in a string when a letter is duplicated.

What are possible scenarios to consider? (For example, think of a few strings that you would want to try with your solution.)
I need to to consieder that the black spaces don't count as a repeating character nor 
any symbol like commas or question marks. I imagine to use words like "cheese", "my little dinosaur", "tornado", etc.

What are some data structures that may be useful? And what would their performance be?
I think a list or dictionary would be the best fit, depending on the context.
If I want to guess the amount of times a letter repeats itself a list would be the best fit by adding 

A dictionary may be useful to use each character as key and set its value the number of times is repeated in the string

I think the performance would be  O(1) in both scenarios

What are the boundary conditions that you should consider for this problem?
I should consider that they're not long text.

Outline a possible solution.
